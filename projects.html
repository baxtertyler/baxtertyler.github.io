                    Two clueless knights have misplaced their swords, and now an army of 
                    mischievous ghosts is out for a spooky showdown. Employ the power of 
                    multitasking as you control both knights, one with arrow keys 
                    and the other with WASD. Their only weapon? A magical rope! Can these knights
                    survive the spirit onslaught and become the ultimate 
                    ghostbusters in this endless adventure?

                <p>Program created in Java with Processing</p>
                <p>
                    This simulated program displays the creation of an infinitely expansive 
                    virtual world inhabited by interactive entities. These entities exhibited dynamic 
                     behavioral changes in response to simulated events, offering a captivating 
                     simulation experience. An ingenious A-star pathing strategy was devised 
                     and seamlessly integrated, revolutionizing entity movement and enhancing 
                     their ability to navigate the virtual landscape effectively. The project showcased a 
                     meticulous emphasis on inheritance and abstract classes, facilitating 
                     modularity and extensibility throughout the simulation's codebase.
